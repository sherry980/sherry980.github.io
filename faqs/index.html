<h3><a name="p3">How do I know that the products you sell are authentic? </a></h3>
<p>As an authorized online distributor for all of the designers we feature, we unconditionally guarantee that every item we sell is 100% authentic. <br />Please note that we are unable to comment on the authenticity of any items not purchased from Pernia's Pop-Up Shop.com</p>
<h3><a name="p4">Which size should I choose?</a></h3>
<p>All products are sold by the international sizing scheme used by the designer. To convert this to your usual size, simply click on the 'size conversion chart' link which you will find on every product page.<br /><strong>As sizes can vary greatly by designer, we have also provided the actual dimensions of each product for you to compare with your own body measurements.</strong> Where an item runs small or large to size, this will be identified within the 'size &amp; fit' tab on every product page.<br />In addition, our customer care team can answer all your questions on sizing and fit - simply email<a href="mailto:customercare@perniaspopupshop.com"> customercare@perniaspopupshop.com </a>&gt;for advice.</p>
<h3><a name="p5">Are the colours of products shown on the website accurate?</a></h3>
<p>While we have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colours of the products that appear on the Site, we cannot guarantee that your monitor or screen&rsquo;s display of any colour will be completely accurate, as computer monitors and screens of electronic devices vary.</p>
<h3><a name="p6">How do I know if an item is in stock?</a></h3>
<p>All items are in stock unless &lsquo;SOLD OUT&rsquo; is displayed. Please be aware that even if an item is in your shopping bag, it can still be bought by another customer until you have completed your order. If the product you want to buy is out of stock, please email <a href="mailto:customercare@perniaspopupshop.com">customercare@perniaspopupshop.com</a> to find out if there is a backorder for that item (you will need to be a registered user).</p>

<p>We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Maestro credit and debit cards. <br />We also have Cash on Delivery and Net Banking options.<br />Please note that we do not accept any other methods of payment apart from those listed above.</p>
<h3><a name="p8">Is it safe to use my credit card online at Pernia's Pop-Up Shop? </a></h3>
<p>At Pernia's Pop-Up Shop, your personal online security is important to us. We use the latest SSL encryption technology to store and safely transmit your personal and credit card information through our systems. All orders are processed through a secure checkout system. Additionally, for your safety and protection, we will confirm that the billing address you provide matches the address on file with your credit card company.<br />You may also choose to securely store your credit card details with us.

<h3><a name="p9">Why do I need to re-enter my credit card details when I add a new address?</a></h3>
<p>For your security, whenever you request delivery to a new address we will ask you to provide new credit or debit card details (if you have previously stored them with us). This means that if someone guesses your password and tries to make an order using your account, they will be unable to do so. We hope you understand that this is a valuable precaution designed to protect your personal information.</p>
<h3><a name="p10">How do I remove saved credit card details? </a></h3>
<p>There are two ways to remove previously saved credit card details:<br />- Edit or add new shipping or billing address.<br />- During your next purchase, simply &lsquo;UNSELECT&rsquo; the option &lsquo;REMEMBER MY PAYMENT DETAILS&rsquo; on the payment page.</p>
<h3><a name="p11">Does Pernia's Pop-Up Shop ship to multiple addresses?</a></h3>

<h3><a name="p12">Do I need to sign for my order? </a></h3>
<p>Due to the high value of the goods that we sell, we require proof of delivery for all orders. This means we are unable to authorise packages to be delivered without a signature.</p>
<h3><a name="p13">Can I change my shipping address after my order has been dispatched? </a></h3>
<p>We are unfortunately unable to redirect orders once your items have been dispatched. Therefore, please ensure you provide a suitable shipping address for the specified delivery times.</p>
<h3><a name="p14">Can I add items to an existing order?</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to combine orders or add items to an existing order. If you would like all your items to be delivered together, you will need to cancel your order(s) and place a new order which contains all the items you require.</p>

<h3><a name="p19">Why are shipping restrictions applied to some items? </a></h3>
<p>Due to domestic and international trading agreements and regulations, Pernia&rsquo;s Pop-Up Shop is obliged to adhere to particular shipping restrictions.<br />As a result, we are unable to dispatch items made of exotic skins outside of the EU. In addition, some products manufactured in China and fine jewellery of certain compositions, are not allowed to be shipped to some countries.<br />If you add a product to your shopping bag that we are not permitted to ship to your country, the site will automatically identify it and prompt you to remove it. To proceed with purchasing this item, you would need to ship it to a different destination address. In the case of exotic skins, this would need to be within the EU.
